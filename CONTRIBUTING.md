# Contributing to Awesome Hyprlock

Thanks for sharing your setup ❤️

## How to Submit

1. **Fork this repo**
2. **Upload your lockscreen image to the wiki** (e.g., drag/drop into the `Submissions` page) so it gets a raw URL like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/JayeshVegda/awesome-hyprlock/your-image.png`.
3. **Edit the wiki page `Submissions`** and add one bullet in this exact format:
   - `- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/JayeshVegda/awesome-hyprlock/your-image.png | https://github.com/you/repo | One-line description (max ~80 chars)`
4. The bot will open a Pull Request to sync it into `README.md`
5. Review the generated PR preview and submit

## Submission Requirements

- **Image URL**: Direct link to your lockscreen image (preferred: wiki-hosted PNG/WebP, 16:9 or native)
- **Repo link**: Public GitHub repo, dotfiles repo, or gist with Hyprlock config
- **Description**: One concise line; mention path if the config is nested
- **Privacy**: No personal info in the image or linked content (names, emails, IPs, etc.)

**Example descriptions:**
- `Minimal blur, centered clock`
- `Glassmorphism; see dotfiles/hyprlock.conf`
- `Animated wallpaper with time-based themes`
